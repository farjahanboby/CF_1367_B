# CF_1367_B
Code Forces problem Even Array

index: 0 1 2 3
value: 3 2 7 6

first it will check whether the, index mod 2 is zero and (value of that index) mod 2 is zero. If it is then good. 
And also if index mod 2 is not zero and (value of that index) mod 2 is not zero . That is also good. Because both condition is true. 
If any condition is false then will count that and print that. If all follows this condition then will print 0. else will print -1.
